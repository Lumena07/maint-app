# Vercel Blob Setup Guide

## âœ… Vercel Blob Implementation Complete!

Your aircraft maintenance app has been updated to use **Vercel Blob** for data storage instead of the file system. This will make your demo work perfectly on Vercel!

## ðŸš€ Next Steps to Complete Setup:

### 1. Create a Vercel Blob Store
1. Go to your [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Navigate to **Storage** tab
3. Click **Create Database** â†’ Select **Blob**
4. Name it `aircraft-maintenance-blob` (or any name you prefer)
5. Choose a region close to your users
6. Click **Create**

### 2. Environment Variables (Automatic)
Vercel will automatically create these environment variables:
- `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` - For read/write operations
- `BLOB_READ_ONLY_TOKEN` - For read-only operations (optional)

### 3. Deploy Your App
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Deploy to Vercel (or redeploy if already deployed)
3. The environment variables will be automatically available

### 4. Migrate Your Data
After deployment, make a POST request to migrate your existing data:
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-app.vercel.app/api/migrate-kv
```

Or visit the URL in your browser and use a tool like Postman.

## ðŸŽ¯ What's Been Updated:

- **âœ… Installed @vercel/blob package**
- **âœ… Updated all API routes** to use Blob instead of file system
- **âœ… Created migration tools** to move your existing data
- **âœ… Maintained the same API interface** - no frontend changes needed

## ðŸ”§ How It Works:

1. **Read Operations**: Your app reads from `aircraft-cache.json` stored in Vercel Blob
2. **Write Operations**: Your app writes to the same blob file with `allowOverwrite: true`
3. **Caching**: Blob is cached for 1 minute to allow real-time updates
4. **Global CDN**: Data is served from Vercel's global network

## ðŸ’° Cost:

- **Free Tier**: 1 GB storage, 1,000 operations/month
- **Perfect for demos** and small applications
- **No hidden costs** - only pay for what you use

## ðŸŽ‰ Benefits:

- âœ… **Works on Vercel** - No more file system issues
- âœ… **Persistent data** - Survives deployments and restarts
- âœ… **Global performance** - Served from CDN worldwide
- âœ… **Real-time updates** - Changes persist immediately
- âœ… **Simple setup** - Just create the blob store and deploy

Your demo will now work perfectly on Vercel with full editing and saving functionality!
